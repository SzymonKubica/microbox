The case consists of three components:
- inner case enclosing the Arduino with its input shield and display,
- outer case allowing for attaching the batter pack and storing the power cable,
- 'battery pack' that connects to the outer case using magnets.

## Inner Case

Steps to assemble the inner case:
- get 4 screws with thread diameter of ~ 3mm and head size no larger than 5mm,
- put the reset button part into the hole in the front plate,
- press the arduino and its input shield against the bottom part of the front plate,
- cover the back of the arduino with the back plate,
  - if you want to make button bounce a bit better / prevent them from getting
  stuck you can put some foam / paper between the button section of the input shield
  and the back plate,
- screw in the screws to connect the two parts.

## Installing Magnets to connect Outer Case and Battery Pack

1. Take the outer case and battery pack and put them together so that the
   magnet holes roughly line up.
2. Insert magnets into the holes on either side so that they attract each other
3. Ensure that the magnet polarities are aligned in a consistent way (i.e. all
   magnets applied on the battery pack attract all magnets on the outer case).
4. Once magnets are securely in place:
    1. Apply some super glue on the outer case holes to hold the magnets in place.
    2. Insert the power bank into the battery pack so that it presses against the magnets.
    In case of the battery pack the tolerances are so tight that it is not necessary
    to glue the magnets in. You can do this if you want to make it extra secure.
