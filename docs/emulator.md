## Quick Start Guide

To set up CMake and build the emulator, clone the MicroBox repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:SzymonKubica/microbox.git
```

Then you need to run the following script:
```
./scripts/build-emulator.sh
```
This will do the following:
- create a new directory for CMake build configurations
- enter the directory
- set up CMake there
- execute CMake build process
- create the `/build-emulator/microbox-emulator` artifact

If you want to build the emulator with debug symbols and debug logging enabled,
you should run:
```
./scripts/debug-build-emulator.sh
```
You can now run the emulator by invoking: `./build-emulator/microbox-emulator`

If you want to change the code & recompile the emulator, you need to enter
the relevant build directory (`build-emulator` or `build-emulator-debug`) and
execute:
```
cmake --build .
```
This will update the emulator executable and you can run it from within the
same directory:
```
./microbox-emulator
```

## Building & Running the Emulator

If the above quick start scripts didn't work for you or you are trying to
understand what we are doing step-by-step. Below you can find more detailed
instructions.

MicroBox can run on a regular linux machine as an SFML-based
graphical application. This is configured as a CMake project which is configured
in CMakeLists.txt

To build the emulator for the first time, create directory `emulator-build` and run `cmake ..`
which will configure your local CMake.
To rebuild the emulator, navigate to `emulator-build` and run `cmake --build .`
This should produce an executable `game-console-emulator` that you can run from the
command line.

### Emulator Debugging Workflow

If you want to debug the emulated game console, you need to create a build directory
for the debug build outputs, then enter the directory and created `cmake` debug
build setup as follows:
```bash
mkdir emulator-build-debug
cd emulator-build-debug
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
Once the debug build setup is generated by the above command, you need to build
the emulator. Ensure that you are inside the `emulator-build-debug` directory.
```bash
cmake --build .
```
