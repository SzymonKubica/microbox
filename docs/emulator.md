## Emulated execution

The game console can also be executed on a regular linux machine as an sfml-based
graphical application. This is configured as a CMake project which is configured
in CMakeLists.txt

To build the emulator for the first time, create directory `emulator-build` and run `cmake ..`
which will configure your local CMake.
To rebuild the emulator, navigate to `emulator-build` and run `cmake --build .`
This should produce an executable `game-console-emulator` that you can run from the
command line.

### Emulator Debugging Workflow

If you want to debug the emulated game console, you need to create a build directory
for the debug build outputs, then enter the directory and created `cmake` debug
build setup as follows:
```bash
mkdir emulator-build-debug
cd emulator-build-debug
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
Once the debug build setup is generated by the above command, you need to build
the emulator. Ensure that you are inside the `emulator-build-debug` directory.
```bash
cmake --build .
```
