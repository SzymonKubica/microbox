MicroBox is a handheld retro game console built using off-the-shelf microcontroller
components. It's designed to be hackable and extensible. All of the code and
CAD files open-source. This repository contains a DIY guide allowing you to build
your own MicroBox.

## Project Folder Structure
```
└── src
    ├── common
    ├── config
    ├── fonts
    ├── games
    └── lib
```

- `src` main sources root containing all implementation files and libraries
  required to control the hardware.
- `common` common utilities for creating game menus and reusable UI components..
- `config` contains the header files that specify the pin mappings on the Arduino.
  This is required to ensure that the library code works as expected and is able to
  drive the display. The pin config will depend on how you decide to wire your
  version of the console.
- `fonts` fonts required by the libraries to render characters on the console
  display.
- `games` this folder contains the actual game logic. The idea is that we
  should be able to implement multiple games and reuse the common utilities to create
  UIs.
- `lib` contains the library code that is required to control the LCD display.

## Limitations

The display that I'm currently for the console only allows for redrawing one pixel
at a time. This limits the space of possible games that we can implement.
Anything that requires a large number of pixels to be redrawn between game ticks
is not available. Because of this, this platform is best suited for implementing
text-based games such as 2048 or sudoku.

## Emulated execution

The game console can also be executed on a regular linux machine as an sfml-based
graphical application. This is configured as a CMake project which is configured
in CMakeLists.txt

To build the emulator for the first time, create directory `emulator-build` and run `cmake ..`
which will configure your local CMake.
To rebuild the emulator, navigate to `emulator-build` and run `cmake --build .`
This should produce an executable `game-console-emulator` that you can run from the
command line.

### Emulator Debugging Workflow

If you want to debug the emulated game console, you need to create a build directory
for the debug build outputs, then enter the directory and created `cmake` debug
build setup as follows:
```bash
mkdir emulator-build-debug
cd emulator-build-debug
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```
Once the debug build setup is generated by the above command, you need to build
the emulator. Ensure that you are inside the `emulator-build-debug` directory.
```bash
cmake --build .
```


# :video_game: MicroBox — Arduino Game Console

**MicroBox** is a custom-built **game console powered by the Arduino UNO R4**, designed to bring simple yet classic games to the world of microcontrollers.
Currently, MicroBox supports three built-in games:

- :abacus: **2048** — Merge tiles to reach the magical 2048!
- :boom: **Minesweeper** — Avoid hidden mines using logic and deduction.
- :seedling: **Game of Life** — Watch cellular automata evolve based on Conway’s famous rules.

---

## :jigsaw: Overview

MicroBox is a **C++-based game console framework** that demonstrates how much fun and interactivity can be achieved with limited hardware resources.
It’s designed to be:

- **Modular** — Easily add new games or features.
- **Lightweight** — Runs efficiently on the Arduino UNO R4 with minimal memory usage.
- **Open-source** — Ideal for hobbyists, students, and developers exploring embedded gaming.

---

## :gear: Hardware Requirements

- Arduino UNO R4 (WiFi or Minima)
- OLED or LCD display (depending on configuration)
- Input controls (buttons, joystick, or keypad)
- Optional: Buzzer or speaker for audio feedback

---

## :computer: Software Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/MicroBox.git
   cd MicroBox



:hammer_and_wrench: Adding Your Own Games

MicroBox is designed to make it easy to expand the game library.
You can add new games by:

Creating a new game class that inherits from the base Game interface.

Implementing setup(), update(), and render() methods.

Registering your game in the main MicroBox menu.

:rocket: Future Plans

:art: Add a pixel-based graphics library for richer visuals

:sound: Integrate sound effects and music

:floppy_disk: Save game progress and high scores

:brain: Introduce AI opponents for certain games
