MicroBox is a handheld retro game console built using off-the-shelf microcontroller
components. All of the its code and CAD files open-source.
Follow the [DIY guide](docs/diy-guide.md) if you want to build your own MicroBox.

Want to see if the games are any good? Why not try out the [emulator](docs/emulator.md) and run games
on your machine :computer:?

## [μ] MicroBox - Microcontroller Game Console :video_game:

**MicroBox** is a custom-built **game console powered by the Arduino UNO R4**,
designed to allow for implementing various retro games and switch between them
using an intuitive UI.

Currently, MicroBox features three games:

- :abacus: **2048** — Merge tiles to reach the 2048.
